Lektion 1 - ML-ramverk och arkitektur
Assignment: Frameworks, tensors, and execution models

Instructions:
1. Complete the tasks below with short, runnable code snippets
2. Run each section and observe the output
3. Comment your code to explain what each part does
4. Keep everything in this file unless stated otherwise
"""

# Task 1: Vector and matrix basics (NumPy)
# TODO: Create two vectors (length 3) and compute:
# - dot product
# - L2 norm
# - cosine similarity
# TODO: Create a 2x3 matrix and multiply it by a length-3 vector

# Task 2: Eager vs graph execution
# TODO: Write a small function f(x) = x^3 + 2x
# TODO: Implement f(x) in ONE of:
# - PyTorch (eager)
# - TensorFlow with @tf.function (graph)
# - JAX with @jit (graph-like)
# TODO: Print the output and note how execution differs

# Task 3: Framework comparison in code
# TODO: Using scikit-learn, load the iris dataset
# TODO: Train a LogisticRegression model
# TODO: Train a tiny MLP (MLPClassifier) on the same data
# TODO: Compare accuracy and write 3-5 comments in code about:
# - speed
# - API ergonomics
# - when you would pick each approach

print("Done! You now have a first hands-on view of ML frameworks.")
